## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program
This project was built as part of the Udacity Self Driving Car Nanodegree

### Overview

In this project, I used what I've learned about deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. I trained a model so it can decode traffic signs from natural images by using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). After the model was trained, I tested it on new images of traffic signs I found online and in my neighborhood.

### Dependencies
[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
[Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/)
[Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) 4.2 for Python 3.5 to install the dependencies

### Dataset
Training and Test data should be downloaded from the provided url
Unzip the pickled files into a subfolder named "traffic-signs-data subfolder".
