## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program
This project was built as part of the Udacity Self Driving Car Nanodegree

### Overview

In this project, I used what I've learned about deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. I trained a model so it can decode traffic signs from natural images by using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). After the model was trained, I tested it on new images of traffic signs I found online and in my neighborhood.

### Dependencies
Anaconda 4.2.0 for Python 3.5
Jupyter Notebook

### Dataset
Training and Test data are stored in the traffic-signs-data subfolder.

Future test data will be stored in a different subfolder.
